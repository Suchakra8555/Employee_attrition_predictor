# Employee Attrition Predictor

Predicting employee attrition is a critical task for HR professionals, and this project leverages Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to proactively identify employees at risk of leaving. By implementing targeted retention strategies, organizations can address key factors contributing to attrition, fostering a positive workplace culture.

## Project Overview

In a hypothetical scenario where a company adopts the developed model, factors such as low job satisfaction and limited career growth opportunities contributing to attrition are identified. This empowers the organization to implement focused measures like enhanced employee engagement programs and career development initiatives.

### Challenges Addressed

This project tackles critical challenges associated with employee turnover, including:

- **Costs:** The expense of hiring extends beyond salary, covering recruiting, training, benefits, and more.
- **Training Expenses:** Small companies spent over $1,500 on training per employee, on average, in 2019.
- **Integration Costs:** Bringing a new employee into the organization incurs time and expenditures.
- **Break-Even Period:** It can take up to six months or more for a company to break even on its investment in a new hire.

## Key Features

- **Performance Measure:** Assessing employees' performance metrics.
- **Job Satisfaction Metrics:** Evaluating the satisfaction levels of employees.
- **Work-Life Balance:** Considering the equilibrium between work and personal life.
- **Remote Work Experience:** Taking the remote work experience as a factor of attrition.

Additionally, the project includes the following key components:

1. **Feature Engineering:** Removing all unnecessary columns in attritions and ignoring less priority columns to enhance model performance.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducting EDA to gain a better understanding of the dataset, uncover patterns, and inform decision-making during the model development process.

3. **Logistic Regression for Classification:** Implementing logistic regression, a classic classification algorithm, to predict employee attrition. Logistic regression is used to model the probability of a binary outcome, making it suitable for this predictive modeling task.

4. **Gradient Boosting Regressor:** Utilizing Gradient Boosting Regressor for estimating the in-course time an employee will leave the company. Gradient Boosting is an ensemble learning technique that builds a series of weak learners to create a strong predictive model. In this context, it helps in forecasting the duration an employee is likely to stay with the company before considering attrition.

## Tools Used

This project leverages the following tools and technologies:

- **Jupyter Notebook:** Used for data exploration, analysis, and model development.
- **Python:** The primary programming language for implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Flask:** Employed for building the web application.
- **HTML and CSS:** Utilized for designing and styling the user interface.

Feel free to explore the code in the repository and contribute to the enhancement of this predictive model for employee attrition. Your input is valuable in refining strategies for retaining valuable talent in the ever-evolving workplace.
